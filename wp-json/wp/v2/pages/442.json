They work tirelessly day in, day out. But when they stop working it can cause terrible upheaval and disruption.<\/p><p>As the saying goes, prevention is better than cure. This means making sure you\u2019re looking after your trusty devices. To prolong the life of your printer, we\u2019ve put together a few handy tips, which we recommend you follow.<\/p><ul><li><strong>Do<\/strong>\u00a0stop dust from getting inside your printer by keeping it covered. This is particularly important if you\u2019re not going to be using it for a long period of time.<\/li><li><strong>Do<\/strong>\u00a0clean the outside of your printer at least once a week. We recommend you use a damp lint-free cloth dipped in water. Alternatively you can use a small amount of alcohol to wipe away dust, dirt, animal hair and other contaminants. But\u00a0<strong>don\u2019t<\/strong>\u00a0use strong cleaners as it can damage the printer casing.<\/li><li><strong>Do<\/strong>\u00a0remove the toner cartridge and clean the gears and rollers along the paper path. To clean the rollers use alcohol or Bestine (available in art stores).<\/li><li><strong>Do<\/strong>\u00a0consider investing in a small portable vacuum to clean dirt and dust from the inside of your printer.\u00a0<strong>Don\u2019t<\/strong>\u00a0use a compressed air blower though as the dirt and dust will simply be blasted back into the printer.<\/li><li><strong>Don\u2019t<\/strong>\u00a0store toners in a hot room. They must be kept away from direct sunlight.<\/li><li>Before replacing the toner cartridge,\u00a0<strong>do<\/strong>\u00a0shake it gently from side to side. This will prolong the life of the toner. It also redistributes the toner so that your printer prints evenly across the page.<\/li><li>When using a new toner\u00a0<strong>do<\/strong>\u00a0remember to print a blank page first. By running a clean page through your printer it will pick up lint, dust, and stray toner.<\/li><li>Faulty, damaged or poor quality toner and ink cartridges are responsible for the majority of printer problems.\u00a0<strong>Do<\/strong>\u00a0buy genuine cartridges only.<\/li><li>Before you seek technical help, you should try changing the ink cartridge first. It could just clear up the problem.<\/li><\/ul><h2>\u00a0<\/h2><h2>Common printer faults<\/h2><p>You want your printer to run smoothly. But it can so easily develop faults, leaving you tearing your hair out screaming at it to work.<\/p><p>Common printer faults can range from paper jams and faded print to ghosting and ink smears. So let\u2019s take a look at some of the most common difficulties printers run in to.<\/p><h3>The printer won\u2019t print<\/h3><p>Is it switched on? We kid you not \u2013 it\u2019s more common than you might think. Check the USB cable is plugged in. In case of wireless printers, make sure it\u2019s connected to the Wi-Fi network and if it still won\u2019t print try using a USB cable instead. Are there any warning lights or error messages? Is there printer paper in the tray? Has the printer run out of ink? Always eliminate the basics first.<\/p><h3>Paper gets stuck in the printer<\/h3><p>It\u2019s an annoying but common problem. There could be a tiny shred of paper stuck in the paper feed mechanism. To try and eliminate the problem, remove the paper from the tray, open the printer flaps and check inside. It could be a tricky job so arm yourself with a torch and some long tweezers. Some printers have access panels underneath, giving you easier access to clean the paper feed mechanism. To avoid printer jams make sure you don\u2019t overfill the tray and the paper is aligned properly.<\/p><h3>Poor print quality<\/h3><p>The nozzles on inkjet printer heads can often become blocked and this can lead to horizontal streaks as well as poor colours amongst other things. Cleaning the print heads can solve this problem. Check if there\u2019s an option to do this on the control panel of your printer, or in the printer software on your computer. If in doubt, always refer to your manual. Don\u2019t forget the quality of the paper you use can affect the quality of your printing too. You get what you pay for, so to get the best results use good quality paper.<\/p><h3>Help! My multi-function printer\/scanner has stopped scanning<\/h3><p>Unfortunately faulty scanners aren\u2019t unusual if you\u2019ve got a cheaper MFP. And that can often mean having to replace the whole unit. But before you write it off, try reinstalling the printer\u2019s software.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Printer Maintenance Tips Printers and photocopiers are hard-working machines.
